  This module will allow you to manage Kafka policy in Apache Ranger. Please refer to Apache Ranger documentation for
  authorization policy concept and usage.

Options (= is mandatory):

= admin_password
        The password associated with the admin_username
        [Default: None]

        [Default: None]
- ca_bundle_file
        Useful if Ranger Admin connection is using SSL. Allow to specify a CA_BUNDLE file, a file that contains root and
        intermediate certificates to validate the Ranger Admin certificate.
        In its simplest case, it could be a file containing the server certificate in .pem format.
        This file will be looked up on the remote system, on which this module will be executed.
        [Default: None]

- policies[0..n].audit
        Whether this policy is audited
        [Default: True]
- policies[0..n].enabled
        Whether this policy is enabled.
        [Default: True]
= policies[0..n].name
        The name of the policy. Must be unique across the system.
        [Default: None]
= policies[0..n].permissions
        A list of permissions associated to this policy
        [Default: None]
= policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].accesses
        A list of access right granted by this permission.
        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].delegate_admin
        When a policy is assigned to a user or a group of users those users become the delegated admin. The delegated admin can
        update, delete the policies.
        [Default: False]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].groups
        A list of groups this permission will apply on.
        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].ip_addresses
        A list of source IP addresses to be bound to this permission
        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].users
        A list of users this permission will apply on.
        [Default: None]
= policies[0..n].topics
        A list of Kafka topics this policy will apply on. Accept wildcard characters '*' and '?'

        <yourClusterName>_kafka.
        It must be set if there are several such services defined in your Ranger Admin configuration, to select the one you
        intend to use.

        on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        [Default: True]
EXAMPLES:

# Allow user 'app1' to publish to Kafka topic 'topic1'. And allow user 'app2' and all users belonging to groups 'grp1 and grp2 to consume.
