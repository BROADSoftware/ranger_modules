  This module will allow you to manage HBase policy in Apache Ranger. Please refer to Apache Ranger documentation for
  authorization policy concept and usage.

Options (= is mandatory):

= admin_password
        The password associated with the admin_username
        [Default: None]
= admin_url

        [Default: None]
- ca_bundle_file
        Useful if Ranger Admin connection is using SSL. Allow to specify a CA_BUNDLE file, a file that contains root and
        intermediate certificates to validate the Ranger Admin certificate.
        In its simplest case, it could be a file containing the server certificate in .pem format.
        This file will be looked up on the remote system, on which this module will be executed.
        [Default: None]
= policies
        The list of policies you want to be defined by this operation.
        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].audit
        Whether this policy is audited
        [Default: True]
= policies[0..n].column_families
        A list of HBase column families this policy will apply on. Accept wildcard characters '*' and '?'.
        [Default: None]
= policies[0..n].columns
        A list of HBase columns this policy will apply on. Accept wildcard characters '*' and '?'
        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].enabled
        Whether this policy is enabled.
        [Default: True]
= policies[0..n].name
        The name of the policy. Must be unique across the system.
        [Default: None]
= policies[0..n].permissions
        A list of permissions associated to this policy
        [Default: None]
= policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].accesses
        A list of access right granted by this permission.
        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].delegate_admin
        When a policy is assigned to a user or a group of users those users become the delegated admin. The delegated admin can
        update, delete the policies.
        [Default: False]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].groups
        A list of groups this permission will apply on.
        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].users

        A list of HBase tables this policy will apply on. Accept wildcard characters '*' and '?'
        [Default: None]
- service_name
        In most cases, you should not need to set this parameter. It define the Ranger Admin HBase service, typically

        on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        [Default: True]
EXAMPLES:

# This playbook snippet will:
# - Grant full rights to user 'user1' on all table in namespace 'ns1' ('ns1:*'). Including table creation and delegate admin.
# - Grant RW rights to all users of group 'users' on the table 't1' of this namespace 'ns1'
#
# Note also how we handle Certificate bundle, by first copying it on the remote site.
