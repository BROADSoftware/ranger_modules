        intermediate certificates to validate the Ranger Admin certificate.
        In its simplest case, it could be a file containing the server certificate in .pem format.

        [Default: True]
- policies[0..n].enabled
        Whether this policy is enabled.
        [Default: True]
= policies[0..n].name

        [Default: None]
= policies[0..n].permissions

        [Default: None]
= policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].accesses

        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].delegate_admin

        update, delete the policies.

EXAMPLES:

# This playbook snippet will:
# - Allow all members of group 'users' to submit jobs on queue 'sales'.
# - Grant admin rights fir user 'admin' on the same queue.
#
# Note also how we handle Certificate bundle, by first copying it on the remote site.
