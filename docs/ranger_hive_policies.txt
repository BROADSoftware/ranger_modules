        Whether this policy is audited
        [Default: True]

        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].delegate_admin
        When a policy is assigned to a user or a group of users those users become the delegated admin. The delegated admin can
        update, delete the policies.
        [Default: False]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].groups

        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

        on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        [Default: True]

# This playbook snippet will:
# - For all columns of all tables of databases mydb and mydb2:
#   - select, and update on all users of group 'users'
#   - Full accesses including admin rights to the user 'admin' 
#
# Note also how we handle Certificate bundle, by first copying it on the remote site.
