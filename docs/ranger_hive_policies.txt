= admin_password
        The password associated with the admin_username
        [Default: None]

- policies[0..n].audit
        Whether this policy is audited
        [Default: True]
= policies[0..n].columns
        A list of Hive columns this policy will apply on. Accept wildcard characters '*' and '?'. This is exclusive of 'udfs'

= policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].accesses

        [Default: None]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].delegate_admin
        When a policy is assigned to a user or a group of users those users become the delegated admin. The delegated admin can
        update, delete the policies.
        [Default: False]
- policies[0..n].permissions[0..n].groups
        A list of groups this permission will apply on.

        [Default: None]
- state
        Whether to install (present) or remove (absent) these policies
        (Choices: present, absent)[Default: present]

        on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
        [Default: True]
EXAMPLES:

# This playbook snippet will:
# - For all columns of all tables of databases mydb and mydb2:
#   - select, and update on all users of group 'users'
#   - Full accesses including admin rights to the user 'admin' 
#
# Note also how we handle Certificate bundle, by first copying it on the remote site.
